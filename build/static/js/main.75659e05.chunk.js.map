I moved shortly after to Texas due to hurricane Katrina. As I grew up I had\r\n                    an interest in wanting to understand how \"things\" work. Not too long into highschool I decided I wanted to become an engineer.\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                </p1>\r\n                \r\n                <p2 className='paragraph'>\r\n                        I chose Computer Engineering as my degree path, as it gives me both a taste of hardware and software development. I enjoy software development \r\n                        as it gives me a chance to create anything to my imagination. Thinking out of the box and creating a solution to a problem is one of my favorite\r\n                        things to do, and software engineering allows me to accomplish that in many ways.\r\n                </p2>\r\n                <p3 className='paragraph'>\r\n                        Outside of school, I like to apply my problem solving skills towards Rallycross, a form of off-road racing. Racing vehicles\r\n                        puts a lot of stress on drivetrain components, and oftentimes things will break. On my journey to become a better driver I've had to repair my\r\n                        vehicle plenty of times in various different ways, and I love to be able to get things working again. Motorsports tends to be a\r\n                        \"rich mans\" sport, the costs of maintaining a racecar is extremely expensive. Naturally I cannot afford anything that is competitive,\r\n                        but I bought myself a $600 Crown Victoria off of craiglist, fixed her up myself and I can still enjoy racing on a budget.

To my dismay, none of the Makerbot printers \r\n                    at our school were functional. I spent hours on end diagnosing and repairing issues the 3D printers had at my school. One of the printers had \r\n                    a malfunctioning power supply, which was easy to diagnose as they used the ATX standard, and I was able to use a PC power supply to verify \r\n                    this was the issue. Most of the other printers had extruder issues. If you've ever dealt with Makerbot printers you know what I'm talking about.\r\n                    I would dissasemble the extruders, clean up the gears and remove the clogs. One of the printers had a failing thermistor, so it couldn't \r\n                    tell the temperature of the extruder. This was an easily swappable part. I would also help my peers on how to use the 3D printers. \r\n                    If someone needed help understanding how to export a 3D model into the slicer, I would be the one to teach them. There are so many \r\n                    settings for 3D printing, many of which will highly affect the quality of a print.\r\n                </p1>\r\n                <p1 className='paragraph'>\r\n                    One major 3D printing project involved assisting anatomy class with a new project. They were studying prosthetics, and had to find\r\n                    designs that would be helpful for those with disabilities, and print a functional prosthetic device. I assisted in logging a list of\r\n                    students and their designs that would need to be printed, and getting those prints done. Essentially I managed a 3D printer farm for a \r\n                    few weeks.

Throughout highschool I was obsessed with saving up to afford\r\n                    university without going into debt, and spent most of my time studying and working. At A&M, I volunteered with the Fischer Engineering Design \r\n                    Center, which didn't last very long because I ended up breaking my ankle in a car accident (I love people that run stop signs).

I developed this application for TNTechnologies, an RMM* IT consultant company. We provide\r\n                support and management of businesses IT solutions. We aquired a new PSA* software, Autotask, which will assist helpdesk employees in scheduling tickets.\r\n                One issue arose, autotask has no agent*, which means we had to manually insert all network information for a given client. This saves a lot\r\n                of time as there are thousands of machines and servers to insert into the database.\r\n                <a href=\"https://www.datto.com/products/autotask-psa\">Autotask PSA Link</a>\r\n                    \r\n                </p1>\r\n                \r\n                <p2 className='paragraph'>\r\n                        This is where I stepped in. We already have an agent installed on customers' machines. Atera is RMM software to help automate certain IT tasks. In addition, Atera provides\r\n                        a REST API to collect data from a network. The data that is gathered is as follows:\r\n                        Machine name, IP Address, MAC address, domain name, OS name, OS version, Machine Manufacturer, Machine Model, etc. \r\n                        <a href=\"https://www.atera.com/\">Atera Website Link</a>\r\n                </p2>\r\n                <p3 className='paragraph'>\r\n                    Fortunately, although Autotask did not come with an agent to easily gather information, they did also provide a REST API to insert data into the database.\r\n                    Both services provided excellent developer documentation on the functions for their APIs, and I was able to construct a JavaScript based web application\r\n                    that works as follows. First a list of clients is shown on the screen, then the user can select a client and will be presented with a list of machines. \r\n                    The user can then select a machine, and all data for selected machines will be pushed into Autotask, in the proper client group. Obviously, I have\r\n                    omitted sensitive information in the images below, but I think you can still get a better idea of the scope of this project with them.\r\n                        <img src=\"Atera2Autotask.png\" alt=\"Atera2Autotask Client\" className=\"imgsSmall\"/>\r\n                </p3>\r\n                <p4 className='paragraph'>\r\n                    The biggest challenge in this project involved manipulating the data to work for different objects in Autotask. Atera sorted all of the data into two objects, \r\n                    \"workstation\" and \"client\", however autotask more objects. While they did have workstation and clients, autotask also had a seperate object to track\r\n                    model and make number for an individual machine. So I had to implement the push request in the following steps. First, check for existing client. If client does not exist, \r\n                    create it. If the does exist, use the gathered client ID to initiate the proper requests. This process is repeated for machine make and model. Then once this is done,\r\n                    it can finally insert a workstation, in the proper group, with its system information in place, with the make and model object attached. Autotask will \r\n                    now let our staff know the exact make and model of the computer they are providing support on, as well as other useful workstation information to provide remote IT support.\r\n                    There's many other little details I had to put into this project, such as distinguishing between a server and a workstation. As well as further logic to ensure\r\n                    the reduction of erroneous duplicate entries. \r\n                        <img src=\"Atera2Autotask2.png\" alt=\"Autotask\" className=\"imgs\"/>\r\n                </p4>\r\n                <p4 className='paragraph'>\r\n                    I had plans to fully automate this process. To have the application run as a server that would automatically make sure all the data was up to date.\r\n                    I had an algorithm planned out, however I ran into a brick wall. Both APIs had a request limit that would boot your access after a certain amount of requests in a \r\n                    certain time frame. I decided\r\n                    that the cost-benifit of attempting to reduce the amount of requests to make this work was simply not worth it. I believe I could have implemented a delay\r\n                    that would wait for requests to become available, then continue checking for up-to-dateness. However, it would take me a lot of time and trial of error\r\n                    to implement such a solution, and I wouldn't know if this concept would be functional before I started. \r\n                    Since the current working version already resulted in a great cost-benifit, I decided\r\n                    that this goal should be scrapped.\r\n                </p4>\r\n                <p5 className='paragraphSmall'>\r\n                    *Definitions  <br></br>\r\n                    RMM - Remote Monitoring and Management <br></br>\r\n                    PSA - Professional Serices Automation  <br></br>\r\n                    Agent - a computer program that performs various actions continuously and autonomously on behalf of an individual or an organization  <br></br>\r\n                </p5>\r\n            \r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","import React from 'react'\r\nimport '../../../App.css'\r\n\r\nexport default function ClientChecker(){\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='container'>\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h1 className='about-me'>Client Checker</h1>\r\n                <p1 className='paragraph'>This project is best described on <a href=\"https://github.com/lperniciaro/Client-Checker\">Github</a>\r\n                </p1>\r\n                \r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","import React from 'react'\r\nimport '../../../App.css'\r\n\r\nexport default function WakeOnWan(){\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='container'>\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h1 className='about-me'>Wake On Wan</h1>\r\n                <p1 className='paragraph'>\r\n                    This project was a great experience for me. I got to solve a mildly annoying problem that I had. You see, back in highschool, I liked to remote into my \r\n                    PC using Teamviewer. However, sometimes I would forget to turn on my computer before I left for school. Leaving my computer running 24/7 was not a viable\r\n                    solution. We gotta be energy conscience alright? It seemed that Wake On Lan was a solution to my problem. Wake On Lan is a networking standard that allows\r\n                    a packet to be sent to a machine to turn it on. Only problem was, at school I wasn't on my local network. I tried all the free \"Wake on Wan\" solutions\r\n                    on the internet. None of them worked. Also, I didn't really want to have my laptop running 24/7 to accomplish this, as another machine still had to be\r\n                    on the local network to send the request. I also tried sending a Wake On Lan request from outside of the network, however my router blocked the request\r\n                    as it is a security concern.\r\n                </p1>\r\n\r\n                <p1 className='paragraph'>\r\n                    I had recently purchased a raspberry pi, and I thought to myself \"Hey, wouldn't it be cool if I could have the raspberry pi send the request?\". So thats what I did.\r\n                    I used a publicly available java library to send a Wake On Lan packet, and created a server that I could run on a raspberry pi. I was able to create a java client,\r\n                    where I would input the relevant IP and MAC address information, and I could now initiate a Wake On Lan request from anywhere in the world. I also \r\n                    created an Android based client that did the same thing, because why not?\r\n                </p1>\r\n                <h1 className='about-me'>The Bad News</h1>\r\n                <p1 className='paragraph'>\r\n                    Unfortunately, back in highschool when I did this project, I didn't really understand the importance of backing up your data.

The bootleg battery is 4x Samsung 3500mAH 18650 battery cells in series forming\r\n                    a whopping total of 14,000mAH! Unfortunately, I never took a photo of the final project and I have since thrown this project away.\r\n                    For the final revision, I cut a hole in the back shell of the phone to run the wires through, and hotglued the batteries on a battery holder to the back of the phone.\r\n                    Theoretically, with 14,000mAH you would have a battery life of up to 5 days without recharging. However, I hadn't studied electrical engineering whatsoever\r\n                    at this point and there were many pitfalls to my design. \r\n                    \r\n                    <img src=\"PhoneExtender.jpg\" alt=\"Danger\" className=\"imgsSmall\"/>\r\n                </p1>\r\n                <p1 className='paragraph'>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    First of all, the original battery had communication lines. Without them, the phone\r\n                    has no idea what the battery percentage is, and would turn off every 15 minutes. Second of all, I never had a BMS that would ensure each cell \r\n                    is at the same voltage. This is dangerous as high currents can flow if each cell does not have the exact same voltage. I was truly dreaming\r\n                    that I could have a 14,000mAH hot swappable battery bank attached to the back of my phone. Although the project was not a success, I'm\r\n                    glad I learned what I did and I'm glad I at least got the phone to turn on. So that's why I call it a concept, because it's technically still\r\n                    possible to achieve such a ridiculous design.\r\n                    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_management_system\">More info on how BMS works</a>\r\n                </p1>\r\n                <p1 className='paragraph'>\r\n                    \r\n                    I also really can't complain in any way. This phone had water damage and was unable to charge prior to me hacking it all up. So \r\n                    really I didn't waste anything by \"ruining\" the phone in the end.\r\n                </p1>\r\n                \r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}","import React from 'react'\r\nimport '../../../App.css'\r\n\r\nexport default function SmartHome(){\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='container'>\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h1 className='about-me'>Model Smart Home</h1>\r\n                <p1 className='paragraph'>\r\n                    The model smart home was a project for my highschool physics class.
