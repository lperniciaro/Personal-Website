                <div className='smallcard'>I wanted to have my personal information on my resume protected from web scrapers and bots using
                    my personal infromation to spam me. I decided to use Google reCaptcha v3 to protect my resume. This required me to set up a backend
                    for my previously static website. I chose Python Flask / Gunicorn with Nginx proxy to accomplish this task securely. When attempting to access the resume,
                    first a token is generated, which is sent to the backend to validate on Google's servers. Google returns a trust score from 0-1, and if the score is below 50%,
                    the request is blocked. This should provide a nice layer of security for my personal information.
