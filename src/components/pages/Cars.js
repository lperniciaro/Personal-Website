      description: `I found a 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis on Craigslist for $600. Here's how I tackled the project...`,
      content: `The story of the Grand Marquis is a tale that starts with a dream to have a project car. A project which will allow me to tinker and learn the inner workings of a vehicle.\
      I had been searching for an old Crown Victoria at police auctions for a long time, but had found nothing that was worth biting the bullet on. Years had gone by, and I remember the day I found\
      the craigslist post like it was yesterday. I was sitting in the hallway at Texas A&M, waiting to see my academic advisor â€” every college students favorite pastime. As any self respecting 'car guy'\
      would, I decided to check craigslist on an impulse for the 'Mercury' branded version of the Crown Victoria. I was shocked in amazement to see a listing for $900. \
      \
      \n\n There it was. My first project car. I immediately proceeded to contact\
      the owner. After a few days of stewing and binge watching videos about the Panther Platform, I went to the owners house to see the car. I was revolted. One of the fenders was rusted out, the car had sat\
      under a tree for 5 years, and it was covered in green sap and snail trails. My first impressions were dissapointment: "I don't think I'm getting this car..." I said to myself. \n\n
      
      Initially, I had thought the 50k miles on the car was suspicious. Too good to be true. Probably a rollback odometer scam right? But then I saw the interior. The glorious interior. When I first sat in that seat I was overwhelmed\
      with joy as the perfect condition interior transformed me into the 2004 timecapsule I didn't even know I wanted. Within seconds I went from extreme dissapointment to - "I think I'm getting this car!". \
      Plush leather seats, plenty of space, and a classic 'grandma special' vanilla scented air freshener that will be forever engrained into the nostalgia of my brain. \n\n We tried starting the car, and it ran! .... For 2 seconds... and died.\
      Wouldn't start back up. I found this as great news. The engine sounded healthy when it did run, so there was clearly a small issue preventing it from running. However, it's failure to run means I have negotiation leverage!\
      I got the owner down to $600, and the car was mine.`,
