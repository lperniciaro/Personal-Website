      content: `It was a 2 day event. Around 300 cars attending. I was in the stock rear wheel drive class. I was a bit too eager to start and decided \
      to line up near the front of the line. This was a mistake. The 'track' was just a grass field with cones, and had still yet to become a track yet. \
      It was extremely slippery, like driving on ice. Not a great start. Still though, I could tell the track design was one of the fastest I've raced in rallycross. \
      I definitely achieved a top speed of ~50-60mph. By the end of the 2 day event I was battered. Rallycross requires a working component. There are 3 class groups \
      and the two other groups run the cones and call out the cones that are knocked over. Given that there were over 300 cars, and this was my largest rallycross event \
      by far, there was a lot of work to be done. \n\n Somebody flipped their car on the corner I was working! \
      My biggest regret of this event is standing there in shock like a dumbass taking a picture, instead of giving immediate assistance to the guy who almost \
      just lost his arm. He got extremely lucky. I saw his arm come out of the window as it was flipping through the air. Luckily, he was able to pull it back \
      in before it rolled over, and he came out of this disaster with no injuries. We had to stand out in the extremely dusty field for hours. This was also covid time where we were expected to wear \
      a mask. Though, to be honest. They came in handy so I could breathe with the dust. By the end of the event I was happy to have beat a few miatas \
      (because they spun out a few times), so I didn't come last! Mission success!`,

      content: `2020 Dirtfish Rallycross National Championship in Topeka, Kansas. It was a spur of the moment decision to join. My friend Chase \
      was going in his 1st generation rally Subaru, an actual race car. I was going in what was basically my daily driver, he was driving a stripped \
      down race car with extremely low gearing. The top speed of our trip was 60mph as that was over 4k RPM for his car. It was not exactly my idea of \
      the most fun roadtrip, but we made it with no issues. It's time to race. Since we are at nationals and I'm driving a stock crown vic, my goal is \
      anything that isn't last place. :D`,

      content: `At the very end of the rallycross event, I decide to let Brianne Corn, the owner of the racetrack go on a joyride in the vehicle. But, something wasn't right.
      I knew the vehicle didn't have a limit slip differential, but she was really having a hard time getting the car sideways. I chalked it up to her not knowing the car, but
      as soon as I got back in I saw the dreaded check engine light. And even worse, it was flashing, indicating a misfire. The engine still ran okay, but under high load at low RPM
      it would misfire horribly. I drove it home with overdrive gear disabled, and it limped home ok.\
      \n
      \n
      First things first is going to AutoZone to read the trouble codes.\n
      P0303: Cylinder 3 Misfire\n
      P0302: Cylinder 2 Misfire\n
      P0171: Bank 1 System too lean\n
      \n
      I decided tackling it on my own with no prior mechanical diagnostic experience. Googling around I determine I may have a vacuum leak. So, I decide to do a smoke test.\
      I get a non nictotine vape pen, and blow smoke into the intake. I don't really see anything but see a tiny wisp come out of the EGR valve. I decide to replace the EGR valve from the junkyard.\
      Nothing. Waste of time. Seems like they do leak a tiny bit when you put smoke in the direction it's not supposed to go.\n\n
      
      I tried a tune up, changing the spark plugs. Nothing. I researched and researched, weeks had gone by and I still hadn't found a solution. I wound up at race track again.\
       At this time of year we would all randomly show up and do random car stuff when we were bored. I consulted with Brianne to ask what she thought about the issue.\
        Given the trouble codes, she believed I had a fuel related issue. This is because Bank 1 system too lean indicates that the engine is not getting enough fuel.\
         I don't know why I didn't explore this avenue. At the time, I'm pretty sure I just didn't want to touch the gross stink fuel. Since Brianne gave me that recommendation,\
          I decided to take out the fuel rail and look at the fuel injectors.\n\n I found my smoking gun. The fuel injectors were clogged with thick crust. I took the injectors out,\
           and let them soak in an ultrasonic cleaner. That still didn't get all the crud out. I was able to blast it away with a can of electronics cleaner. In the picture of\
            the tupperware above, that is all the crud that came out of the injectors. I put it all back together, and the car ran like a dream. I was so happy to have fixed it.\
      \n\n
      
      Did I forget to mention I decided to cheap out and get a knockoff fuel filter? Yeah. Not making that mistake again. Cheap out on parts and pay the price. \
      It's entirely possible the situation could have happened with a genuine filter, since the car sat for a while and the sediment is likely rust in the fuel tank that I did not clean, \
      but I digress. I learned a lot about diagnostics, and not to jump the gun and throw random parts at things.`,

      looked extremely ugly. I initially thought it would be a simple swap of the front grill, but boy did I sign myself up for a mini junkyard adventure.\
      I had to get the front bumper, header panel, headlights, and grill. While I was at it, I also grabbed a fender that wasn't rusted out. I was able to source the parts from\
      a real police car that was severly rear ended. I got to town and got the parts swapped over. The headlights required soldering new connections, as the design was completely different.\
      I kept the original Grand Marquis corner lights, as they turn on side lamps (cornering lights) when you turn your blinkers on, allowing you to see where you're turning when it's dark.\
      This feature doesn't even exist in some really nice cars! The final product was a car that looked like a Crown Victoria, but had the interior of a Grand Marquis.`,

      However, the journey did not start without some hiccups. The landlord forced it out of the property :/.
      I emergency found a nearby storage unit, and got it towed off property. Not a great start to the project. Thankfully, I did not need that unit for long. I had correctly diagnosed the issue as a fuel pump and the car was running!\n\n
      
      The first test drive had it's issues, but great first impressions. I put it into reverse and it effortlessly backed out, with somewhat extremely sketchy, but 'technically stopping the vehicle' brakes. It went into drive just fine,\ 
       and I slowly creeped it out of the grass parking lot. The rough terrain ripped some sagging trim underneath the engine. As we pulled out on to the road, I eagerly awaited each gear shift to see if I had made a good purchase, or if I\
      just gave myself thousands of dollars of 'buy a new tranmission' debt. Everything checked out. The air condition even worked! The tires were hard as rocks and the first major purchase were a new set of the cheapest tires\
      I could get from Walmart. Next a trip to the local junkyard to get the missing corner lights and bulbs, to make the car legal and registerable. I got the car registered and promptly parked it right back at my apartment complex. The\

      content: `The story of the Grand Marquis is a tale that starts with a dream to have a project car. A project which will allow me to tinker and learn the inner workings of a vehicle.\
      I had been searching for an old Crown Victoria at police auctions for a long time, but had found nothing that was worth biting the bullet on. Years had gone by, and I remember the day I found\
      the craigslist post like it was yesterday. I was sitting in the hallway at Texas A&M, waiting to see my academic advisor — every college students favorite pastime. As any self respecting 'car guy'\
      would, I decided to check craigslist on an impulse for the 'Mercury' branded version of the Crown Victoria. I was shocked in amazement to see a listing for $900. \
      \
      \n\n There it was. My first project car. I immediately proceeded to contact\
      the owner. After a few days of stewing and binge watching videos about the Panther Platform, I went to the owners house to see the car. I was revolted. One of the fenders was rusted out, the car had sat\
      under a tree for 5 years, and it was covered in green sap and snail trails. My first impressions were dissapointment: "I don't think I'm getting this car..." I said to myself. \n\n
      
      Initially, I had thought the 50k miles on the car was suspicious. Too good to be true. Probably a rollback odometer scam right? But then I saw the interior. The glorious interior. When I first sat in that seat I was overwhelmed\
      with joy as the perfect condition interior transformed me into the 2004 timecapsule I didn't even know I wanted. Within seconds I went from extreme dissapointment to - "I think I'm getting this car!". \
      Plush leather seats, plenty of space, and a classic 'grandma special' vanilla scented air freshener that will be forever engrained into the nostalgia of my brain. \n\n We tried starting the car, and it ran! .... For 2 seconds... and died.\
      Wouldn't start back up. I found this as great news. The engine sounded healthy when it did run, so there was clearly a small issue preventing it from running. However, it's failure to run means I have negotiation leverage!\
      I got the owner down to $600, and the car was mine.`,
